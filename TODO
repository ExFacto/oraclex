Problems:

Unsolvable:
- We can't have users sign with any library other than bitcoinex, because no one
can take a PSBT and create an adaptor sig from it.

Solution: Oraclex is a wallet

Build:
- BIP39 (mnemonics). Use external lib?
- Receive to key-only P2TR
        - This simplifies max-witness length
- Send to any valid Bitcoin address
- Determine chain from env

I dont know how:
- set up PHX web w/ CSS

Optimal path:
- Use CLI tool?

Actions:
- Declare initial coin
     - Initial coin:
        - Address currently in
        - Txid:vout of coin
        - amount

- Declare funding pubkey & Amount

- Declare settlement address

- Accept Funding TX, Counterparty Pubkey, verify script

- Accept & Sign CET TXs, send back Adaptor Signatures

- Receive Counterparty Adaptor Sigs & Verify them

- Receive Oracle Resolution & Extract key & Decrypt signatures

- Broadcast Bitcoin Tx / send to server
