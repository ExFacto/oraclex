Problems: 

Unsolvable: 
- We can't have users sign with any library other than bitcoinex, because no one
can take a PSBT and create an adaptor sig from it. 


I dont know how:
- set up PHX web w/ CSS

Optimal path: 
- Use CLI tool? 


ACtions:
- Declare initial coin
     - Initial coin:
        - Address currently in
        - Txid:vout of coin
        - amount 

- Decalre funding pubkey & Amount

- Declare settlement address

- Accept Funding TX, Counterparty Pubkey, verify script

- Accept & Sign CET TXs, send back Adaptor Signatures

- Receive Counterparty Adaptor Sigs & Verify them

- Receive Oracle Resolution & Extract key & Decrypt signatures

- Broadcast Bitcoin Tx / send to server
